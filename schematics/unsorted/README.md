# Unsorted schematics

Designs in here should be mostly my own, most heavily based on Ilmango's work.
As an example, the manual stone generator is a reverse engineered version of
one he briefly showed in his SciCraft series, on the other hand the bee farm
is a complete rework. I'll move these schematics to their proper place whenever
I get a chance to fully review them.
